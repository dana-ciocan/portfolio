# Next.js portfolio website

I wanted to give using Next.js for a basic portfolio website a go. This site uses the following stack:

- Next.js
- React
- Chakra UI

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment on Vercel

This site is deployed on Vercel whenever the `main` branch is updated.
